# Harvesting Brilliance: A Taxonomic Tale of Pumpkin Seed Varieties 🎃🌱

## 📌 Project Overview

**Harvesting Brilliance** is a machine learning–driven project focused on the classification and analysis of pumpkin seed varieties based on their morphological and genetic characteristics. Pumpkin seeds, though nutritionally rich and agriculturally significant, are often underexplored in terms of taxonomy and data-driven classification. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to study seed diversity and build an predictive model that can accurately classify pumpkin seed varieties through an interactive web interface.

The goal is to bridge agriculture, nutrition science, and technology by providing a practical tool that supports farmers, researchers, and food innovators in understanding and utilizing pumpkin seed diversity.
